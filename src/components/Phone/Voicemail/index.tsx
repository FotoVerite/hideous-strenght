It is people that are haunted.  
By grief,  by longing,  by regret,  and pain. 
Sweet  sweet  pain. 

A rock does not have pain.  
It can contain pain.  But not to itself.  
Only to the people who see it,   who can sense the pain.

Without people there are no ghosts. 

They're just objects.  They go on like me.
