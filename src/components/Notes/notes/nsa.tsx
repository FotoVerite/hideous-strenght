        I'm not going to pretend I'm a prude. Especially to myself. I like sex,
        I like sex with new people. I like the excitement, I like how I don't
        exactly know what they want from me, what i want from them. One of the
        hardest parts of being with Matt. It's not the monogamy but just the
        lack of libido. Some days I wonder if he's asexual.

        And I don't know how to talk to him about it. He just kinda waves it off
        or talks about his stomach. There's a wall, a big and brick and I don't
        have the right tools to deal with it. So I just shutup and move
        on.Because it's easier.

        I think that's the thing I miss the most. The impermanence of it all.
        Trying on new persona, pushing myself a bit both in what I did and how I
        acted. I will always be a bit of a wallflower. I rather someone else be
        in control. I very very much rather someone be in control. But at least
        I could attempt to pry a bit at those edges. Try to be a bit more
        assertive and decide it wasn't for me or wasn't that me for the night.

        Here, I'm always the one pushing. I'm always the one trying to placate
        or start us up and it's exhausting. There is no changing of roles. There
        is no new, just this endless now and repitition.

        I don't need him to change but I need him to at least explain what he
        wants. He really does want a mind reader. I can see how that would be
        intoxicating. Someone who just knows what you need always. What needs to
        be said, what needs to be touched, what needs to be done. But that's a
        delusion. Psychics aren't real.

        So what am I going to do about it. Easy enough to cheat around. God
        knows I did it before him. But I wasn't happy with myself.
