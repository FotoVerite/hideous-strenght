        Sometimes out of the blue it all seems too much. Everything seems to
        much. A spiral of failure with me at the center. No partner, a terrible
        job I keep for the money. An impossibility of being an adult and just
        taking care of myself and my apartment correctly. I'm a failure, I've
        always will be a failure. I'm meek and soft spoken and I let people walk
        over me. I only take charge when I know there won't be any resistance.
        It easy then. Of course it is.

        I don't even know why I'm writing this. Like it's going to make me feel
        better. Pull me out. I'll just flounder and then ten minutes later push
        it down and act like it isn't eating away at me. A silent infestation,
        chipping away till I just fall down into dust.
