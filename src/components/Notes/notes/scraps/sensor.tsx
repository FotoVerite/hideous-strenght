        It's beeping again. The damn fire alarm. Every single time I've
        forgotten to buy a new battery for it. And there's no ladder, and it
        keeps ringing and I don't know what to do at 2am. I don't want the
        neighbors to complain. I don't want to get kicked out because I'm too
        much of a bother. I don't want people to notice me. It's hard enough
        being who I am. Having to worry about people judging me. All the time.
        all the time, all the time.
