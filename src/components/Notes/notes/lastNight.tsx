        My therapist has told me the best thing to do when I have these dreams
        are to write them down. Try to process them instead of just turning it
        over in my head. Fuck, but this time it was bad. asd asdasdasdad j

        I feel asleep. I'm still groggy but I can't get it out of my head. It's
        not supposed to feel like anything. I'm just supposed to not be able to
        move, not scream which is bad enough. But for eyes to be so clear this
        time. Not a moving mass of black ink. But sharp and in relief in the
        light of the streetlamp.

        But it opened it's mouth. It talked to me... It it. I don't want to do
        this. I wish it was a night terror. Leave me screaming in the night
        without knowing why, no this when I can remember ever single moment.
        It's too much.

        Again. Usualy it doesn't happen this often. It was more subtle this
        time, which might be worse I don't know. I can't shake it was real.
        Weight suddenly being felt next to me on th bed, small like a rat or a
        cat. Walking towards my head. One step then another. Pulling my body
        towards it and the matteress shapes itself around it. Then it scurries
        over my pillow. So close I could feel it's hairy legs. And then,
        nothing. No sound. Just the intake of air as I jump up with a scream.

        And I know it can't be real. I've dealt with field mice in my house
        before. Gross small noisy things. Having to find leftover latex gloves
        from the beginning of the pandemic. Wasn't taking any chances on getting
        bit. Chasing it around and finally getting it by the tail and throwing
        it out into the cooling air of fall. I heard it the moment I got home.
        Searching the box my mother foisted on me from our old house. There's no
        way there's one here now. There just isn't. Yet I can't keeep from
        looking around.
