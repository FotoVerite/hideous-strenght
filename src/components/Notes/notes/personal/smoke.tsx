        I'm vacantly staring out into the rain as I savour my fourth cigarette
        of the day. What a waste of a streak. 6 months of not having a single
        one to this mess. Unlike most people this isn't an actual addiction, in
        a few days I'll be done with my pack and it'll be at least two months
        till I get the urge or am depressed enough to go to the corner bodega
        and get another one. A chipper till a day I die. Always, Marlboro Reds,
        not because they're my favorite, but cause they're the easiest to
        remember. I still sometimes as for Camel Reds, but that just get
        confusion from every shop I been in the last few years. ACtually smoking
        is a dying art. For multiple reasons.

        Camel Reds aren't my favorite anyway, just how my brain works and what
        it asks for. What I want is a box of lucky strikes, but good luck with
        that. I haven't seen one in a literal decade. I know they're around but
        not in NYC or at least where I go. That or a pack of Winston's if only
        to remember Ben fondly. Some days I wonder if I bubble up in his
        thoughts or Charlies... but I doubt it. Those days are a lifetime ago. A
        different person.

        Another deep breath out watching the smoke rise above to the half
        finished glass awning of the forever construction next to my building.
        Ten years fast forward and forever careening higher into the sky but no
        less unfinished. Rooms as vacant as my eyes right now, half finish
        industrial ceilings and inset lights. Some are turned on randomly and I
        always wonder why, why that room and not another.

        Across the street the gut renovated complex winks in the darkness.
        Someone once told me they shot scenes from girls there. But can't
        remember who, and honestly it never really interested me enough to find
        out. But I try so little to find out thing I think.

        That's the rub that has me out here at 11pm smoking my fourth. How
        uncurious I've been forever. How I've wrapped myself in mundanity and
        routine to hide from the work of exploration. Who are the people down
        the street from me. The one couple with their white schnauzer. I think
        they threw away their fridge last week, but it could be the upstairs
        neighbors.

        I know it's cliche in big cities. To not know the people in your
        building yet the ones across the street. But I've been here a decade,
        decade plus.The world changes around me and I'm simply me.
