        I've found myself waking up more and more reaching for someone, anyone
        and finding where I'm reach for empty and cold. Like a freezing breeze
        over my skin as I my eyes open, finding nothing but space between them.
        I used to think it was Matt I was reaching for. But I don't even know.
        Maybe it's not a person, just the feeling of a boundary, between me and
        the darkness. Oh god what does that even fucking me. Even alone my
        pretentiousness lashes out and confounds simplicity. Who am I trying to
        impressive with my elocution. It's so very basic.

        Am I lonely, I don't know?... I'm used to being alone. So when I reach
        out, send a arm over to the side of me, I don't expect him to be there.
        But I want someone to be there. I want to be worth that to someone. I
        want to be worth staying around for. And I've been doubting that. That
        I'm just a break for most guys. Something easy, asking little, meaning
        even less.

        Always... always I come back to what other people want. it's like I'm
        just an empty space looking for how best to contain myself for the
        person coming through. Hyper-analyze what I say, how I walk, how I reach
        out and kiss, hold them, comfort them. There's so little thought to me,
        of my permanence of myself in all these calculation. Like I'm some damn
        highway, some hallway between real destinations. A liminal unimportant
        space.

        There I go again. Obfuscating my thoughts even to myself cause it's
        easier then just saying I want a husband, I want someone who will stick
        around even when I mess up. Why is that so hard to admit.
