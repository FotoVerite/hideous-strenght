        I was biking back from my friend's Larry's house in LIC today, like I've
        done dozen of times before and I just... lost myself on the road back.
        Like I just stopped being me for a moment, or that this moment was the
        only moment. Jamais vu? It's the closest I've come to the feeling. An
        endless feeling. Of being stretched out towards eternity that this is
        myself forever now. This is it. This will always be it.

        I saw myself from outside myself. Not out of body, something more
        primal, more dangerous because it was saying something to me. This path
        that I've taken over and over again in all it's minor variations. How
        many times, how much has it become routine. The same type of bike, the
        same time of night, the same fucking clothes. I've had this coat over a
        decade. If someone showed me a photo of myself five years ago doing
        this, would I be able to tell what year, what decade. Where I was in my
        life. Is there anything holding me down here. Anything marking the
        milestones. Or it just slow slow erosion of myself as I walk towards
        death.

        I felt stretched out and aimless. Like a piece of taffy caught in the
        tooth of some unknowable mouth forever being chewed and passed around in
        circles, the taste long gone. Oh god, no I don't really mean cosmic
        horror. It's not a real mouth, a real elder god. @_@. Just the feeling
        of being small and caught up and unable to break free. But kinda guided
        by myself and the world.

        I just feel so constrained by my choices. That I've become lesser then I
        wanted. I used to dream so big, want so much and now I'm just be happy
        owning my own apartment. I used to want to be someone. I used to think I
        was someone.
