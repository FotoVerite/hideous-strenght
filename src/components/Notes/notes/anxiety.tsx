        All I wanted was to get a pizza for lunch today. But even that seems to
        be beyond me. I don't understand why I have these issues. It's not OCD,
        it's not paranoia. Just sometimes... sometimes I just can't go into
        certain shops. First it was the taco-bell a few weeks ago and now it's
        this sit down pizza joint Motorino.

        Tacobell was mostly because I hate taco bell. It's gross and even at 2am
        I did not want to fuck with it. It's not like it's a weird taco bell
        either. I see people in it always. Just not at 1am in the morning. Go
        figure. Motorino on the other hand.

        Look, I've been there at least 10 times. I still remember the first time
        I went to their old location, before the fire. Was it a fire, No, the
        whole building was designated as unsafe and they needed to close
        everything down. That was a weird day. Just seeing them packing up their
        glassware, plates, beertaps, anything they really could. The building
        was knocked down a few days later.

        Their new location has always been odd though. Always nearly empty and
        too big for the amount of people in there. Sometimes I feel like it has
        to be a front for something. Like the supermarket on Grand that I swear
        I was the only customer for half the time. So many rows empty of people
        no matter time of day.

        But I just couldn't today. It was open but empty. They hadn't even take
        the stools down from the bar and it was 1pm. Just the cook in the back
        by the wood oven and I just... I just couldn't

        I don't understand myself. Why is it impossible for me to do these
        simple things. Yet I can just show up and some random dude's place and
        fuck him. Let him fuck me, be completely irresponsible with myself and
        my boyfriend and everything else in my life.
