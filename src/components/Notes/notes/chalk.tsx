        My hands are damaged. They are stained brown, ripped and calloused from
        iron bars and hexagon plates I use daily. I never thought I would have
        ravaged hands. I see myself as soft, as pampered. But I wanted this. I
        wanted some type of control over myself and my body. My father never
        cared about his. He just diminished, became a fat bulbous lump sitting
        there doing nothing, being nothing, is nothing. Not even being worthy of
        being called bouba. He's empty space.

        I won't have that for myself. I see so much of myself in his moodiness,
        taciturnity, inability to form a coherent story. I don't think he could
        tell one about himself if he tried.

        What does it mean to have an entire life, a history, and not really be
        present for it. For it all to slip through you hands, and end up being
        nothing, having nothing. Lonely and depressed and not even being able to
        trace how you got there. What does it mean for your own child to
        consider you a stranger.

        I will make something of myself I am proud of. I might not get the life
        I want, but I will fight daily to have that life. I won't just sit in a
        chair, wait for something to come my way. Thinking I'm owed anything.
        Nobody is owed, you need to work. And I will.

        There is chalk on my hands as I write this. There is pain in my left hip
        from a bad squat rep. There are probably hurt ligaments that might never
        heal. But I will take them as what they are, payment. No matter how hard
        it is, I will get up the next day. I will. Cause what else can one do.
