        Some days I wake up, and think, everything of worth I've let run fallow,
        sucked out by time and laziness. Everything that was good about me has
        long ago faded, ended, grounded, trashed. Yeeted into the hudson,
        forgotten about in the sewers that aren't even fit for crocodiles. Or,
        was it alligators. Do the zoomers even know about that myth. Do they
        read Pychon? Do my peers even read Pychon? Ugh even when I'm just trying
        to write my feels I become languorous and highfalutin. Sound and furry
        indeed.

        Lets try that again, as my shrink would say, honest without the mealy
        mouthed overworked thoughts. I feel fucking tired all the time. I feel a
        failure and lost. I feel I run away from those who will save, run away
        from anyone who shows me an actual kindness. It's easy to surround
        yourself with superficial friends, then actually dig in to your and
        their pain. To do the honest work of making something of who you are
        with them and when you aren't with them. To be better, to do better. I'm
        not doing that.

        I just sit here, do my work, play my games, read my books. Have my
        little chats with people I call friends. They would forget me in a week
        if I didn't call them. I wouldn't even a be mote across the sun of their
        mind. My visage is wiped clean ever time I hang up the phone, end the
        chat, spotless.

        There I go again. I only write like this when I'm drunk. Holdover of
        college. Nights on the Quad, reading philosophy with Ben and Vladic,
        Charlie smoking cigarettes besides us, smoke billowing up into her hair.
        God, I forgot about her till just this moment. Pensive ghost. I forget
        her but not Spencer. Not one day. But that's also a lie.

        I really do lie to myself too often. What did Matt always say. My
        silence hides an ocean of depth, if I would only let it break through.
