        I have no idea how one dates. I don't know how to be open about my
        feelings. I always worry I'll push them away from me. That my real
        feelings will be to strong, and I'll lose them.
      </NoteText>

      <NoteText ph={'p1'}>
        So I hedge. I don't ask for what I want. I let them give me kernels. Why
        is it that everyone I become involved with is so cold. No hand holding
        in public, no pet names, no... normalcy or what I thought was normalcy.
        What does a normal relationship look like?

      <NoteText ph={'p1'}>
        And now that I'm actually dating the person I thought I wanted... why am
        I pulling away.
