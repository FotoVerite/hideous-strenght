        I'm so used to waking up with the feeling of being watch that it's
        become nearly ordinary. Just another part of my night, wake up at 3, see
        shining eyes shake my head a few times as it wanes out of existence. Or
        spider skittering along my vision, or flies, or legs, legs, legs.

        I don't know how to even explain to myself this dichotomy of normality
        and abject horror. What is horror. Ha.

        I used to love horror, it's all I read all I watched. I was a horror
        snob.

        Oh you haven't watch Possession. Isabella Adjani looking more beautiful
        then anyone has any right to be while blood stream down her face from a
        punch from her estranged husband. Rolling around in her own vomit, her
        groceries, lost in religious ecstasy in the subway.

        Oh you haven't watch A Dark Song, you have no idea how hell can be
        illustrated so well for what much be less then what I pay rent in a
        year. No idea who Aleister Crowley nor the Abramelin Ritual.

        Before all this, I thought Horror === Fear. Horror isn't that all.
        That's cheap carnival ride horror, jump scare horror. It's not what that
        word is. Let me tell you want terror is.

        Terror is the ground falling out beneath you. Terror is finding out that
        something you assumed was true for the last 30 years is not so clear
        anymore. Terror is finding out that the people who raised you might not
        have your best interest at heart. Might just have had you to use you.
        Terror is not just the fear, but the doubt, the great gap between the
        object truth and the reality of the moment. Is this really happening to
        me, can I stop it, is it possible to stop it. Am I just doomed. Am I
        doomed?

        Terror is... Terror is waking up to go the to the bathroom at 3am and
        everything seeming normal. Oh so normal till you lay back down and feel
        something, something soft and plush under you. It all so harmless, a
        stuffed banana. You've had it for the past three months on the other
        side of your bed. It's purple and cute and should not cause such
        feelings. But the fact is you sleep on the right side of the bed and it
        wasn't near you when you woke up 5 minutes ago. You're sure of this. You
        know you would have noticed it as you got up. So how is it here now. HOW
        IS IT HERE NOW!

        I spent the rest of the night with all the house lights left up bright.
        With the slow sinking feeling of horror, that I could not trust that
        these eyes gleaming out from the darkness were as harmless as I wished.
