        My latest fuck buddy wants me to sleep over. At least occasionally. At
        least yesterday. Of course he's getting attached. They always get
        fucking attached. I just can't right now. Not with the breakup, not with
        the light, with the insomnia, with everything. It's too much. It's
        always too much, too soon. I can't even pronounce his name correctly.

        It's not like I don't want to try. Do the bare fucking minimum. It's
        been a month and everyone I meet around him uses his damn english name
        he gave himself. How sad that he thinks people will try so little that
        he won't even ask his dog walker to use his real name. And how does Adam
        relate to Manchu! But now it's awkward and I feel bad. I always feel
        bad.

        Sitting in the dark before I decide to leave. He tells me he always
        hears a buzzing in his head since he was a child. A neurological issue.
        An ocean slowly lapping around his neck, rocking him to sleep. But white
        noise is too much for him. Tinitus by any other name is still buzzing.
        We're probably too different.
