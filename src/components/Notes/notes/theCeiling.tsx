        Sleep seems to come harder and harder these days. I don't even know why.
        Is it what's going on with my Job. Is it this stranger besides me. Is it
        myself? Fear of what comes next. I don't know how we got here.`

        I know he's doing his best. But he's so fucking needy. He's already
        started introducing himself as my boyfriend. It's been two months! He
        doesn't talk about the relationship he just accepts its as fact. Alice
        says I should just dump him. Make it easier on both of us. I don't want
        him to get attached.

        much. I feel like I'm breaking apart daily. That everything is breaking
        apart. My life is fouled, dark and gross. That I don't deserve... I know
        I can't indulge these thoughts. They're harmful and false.

        sleep around and settle for a hot bit ass for a few months. It is a hot
        little piece of ass though.
