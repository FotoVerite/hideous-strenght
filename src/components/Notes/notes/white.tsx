        I'm just staring up at my lights, dimmed as much as they can be. Fuck,
        how many nights in a row am I going to have these episodes. I know
        they're not real, but it doesn't matter. I can't quiet down my heart or
        my mind. All I can see is...

        It's so hard to talk about because it's not the thing, it's the feeling.
        The utter alienness and malevolence of it all. When put into words it
        seems so much smaller, and yet it doesn't lessen it grip or me or seem
        silly. It just makes me frustrated that I know nobody would understand
        why I feel this way.

        This time it was a women, she was asleep next to when it started. I
        think blond hair, pale skin, but my vision was staticky like a old tv
        loosing signal. So who knows. Everything was desaturated in the
        streetlight streaming in from my broken blind. I remember reaching out
        to her, I don't know why. Normally I can't move at all, but this time I
        reach out and touched her. She turned towards me and balanced herself on
        her elbows, looking at me. And then I black out for a second and she
        grows.

        I can't explain it. It's not Cronenbergian, it's not a special effect,
        it's more loss time. One second she normal looking the next eye blink
        she three times the size and looking off in the distance. All I have is
        a side view. I wish it kept like that because it happens again.

        She's gigantic, but that's not really it. She's too big, too big to fit
        in the bed, in the room, in this workld. She takes over my entire
        vision. There is nothing but her face; staring into mine. White, such
        white eyes without pupils gazing into mine. Overly plumped black lips in
        an engorged face, slightly open, not moving but strange sounds emitting
        still. I can't hear the words but I know the meaning, hear it singing
        for my soul, saying come to me, it is time.

        I try to move my hands and can't. I feel the blanket yet can't see it
        over my arms. I know this is a dream and yet I still am moved beyond
        terrified to a feeling I've never felt before. And it fades out leaving
        nothing but an empty wall, but it's not really gone is it. Even now as
        dawn breaks in the windows, as I try to use my childhood logic, it is
        morning, the monsters can't get you, they aren't real in the first
        place... I don't know if I believe that.
